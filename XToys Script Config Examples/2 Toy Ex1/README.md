# Two Toy (Vulva/Ass) Config Example

1. Create two instances of the script in XToys.

2. For the first instance:

- Connect script to a toy that you want to react to vulva actions.

- Copy the contents of the configs in the Vulva folder into that script, with xtoys_config_toy_events.json going into the Toy Events box, xtoys_config_vibe_intensities.json under Vibe Intensities, and xtoys_config_actions.json going into Actions.

3. Connect that script's output to the corresponding toy using the little plug icon in the top right. Start the script using the green arrow.

4. Repeat 2-3 but for the Ass in the second instance.

5. Copy the webhook from any script, open up the club, paste into the box that appears, and join any online room.
